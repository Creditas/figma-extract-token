## Features

- Extract foundation styles from API Figma and convert to tokens.
- Extract components style composed by inheritance from foundation tokens.
- Compose multiple format of extraction SCSS, Typescrit, ES6, Android, IOS and
  so on with [Style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/).
- Auto versioning controller, know what really changes from the last extraction.
- Create change log of designers comments on library versioning.
- Automate the token extraction with webhook and automated publish of library.
- Create a dicionary name for the variable composition.
- Works with most css-in-js libraries, composition inspired by
  [Styled system](https://github.com/styled-system).

## Concept

This extractor is based on Foundations and Components, where the Design is the
responsable to create token names, deprecated status, component comment and
composition. The Developers should only create the extractor mapper and Run the
script, all files generated by the extractor should not be modify by the
developer.

To see more check it out
[Documentation](https://robsonmathias.github.io/figma-extract-token/)

## Usage

### Figma configuration

- First on Figma, create at a document based on this
  [Figma Example](https://www.figma.com/file/PodXJDGjtBAdWiWtbrNtIP/POC-Design-Tokens-Extract?node-id=0%3A1),
  is required to compose two pages Foundation and Components.
- Keep the document IDm you're going to need to run the script, you can find on
  url www.figma.com/file/**PodXJDGjtBAdWiWtbrNtIP**/...
- Generate and keep a personal token, you can find on **Main menu/ Help and
  account / account settings**

### Dictionary configuration

```dictionary.config.json
{
  "source": ["build/**/*tokens.json"],
  "platforms": {
    "scss": {
      "transformGroup": "scss",
      "buildPath": "build/scss/",
      "files": [{
        "destination": "_tokens.scss",
        "format": "scss/variables"
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

That file is responsable to compose the extraction of component to a file for
your project. More examples of dictionary configuration check it out on
[Style dictionary Config](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/config)

### Figma extractor configuration

```figma.config.json
{
  "outDir": "./build",
  "dictionaryConfig": "./dictionary.config.json",
  "foundation": {
    "name": "Foundation",
    "children": {
      "Letter Spacing": {
        "extract": ["letterSpacing"]
      },
      "Color": {
        "extract": ["fills"]
      }
    }
  },
  "components": {
    "name": "Components",
    "inheritance": {
      "fills":  "color",
      "letterSpacing": "letterSpacing"
    }
  }
}

```

### Run the command

**Run examples:** Add a environments var with you figma token:

```
export PERSONAL_TOKEN=123123...
```

```
cd example/advanced
yarn
yarn start
```

```
cd example/basic
yarn
yarn start
```

**Extraction:**

```
figma-extract-token--token=PERSONAL_TOKEN --document=DOCUMENT_ID --config=figma.config.json
```

**Build:**

```

```

**Test:**

```
yarn test
```
